Once one truly begins to See they watch as they begin to actively Embody the Change that They want to see in the World.

They no longer cling to maxim's which state, "You Create Your Own Reality".

Such whimsical statements lose all Psuedo-Resonations and become instead a REALITY within the core of their beingness's very framework. They no longer see the need to state the obvious. Who else is going to create their reality?

They also know how to discern fact from fiction. They educate themselves in the Holy Art Of War, and in doing so seek not to subdue their enemies, but rather to learn the Finer Arts such as the Art of Holy Peace, the Serenity of Flow Existence. They study The Art of War because they are no longer Naive enough to ignore the very REAL Danger of "The Silent War" which is waged upon all of humanity, and know that they MUST indeed fight.

As they actively tend to their sacred fire, keeping the Creatures of The Dark from dousing it whilst they are unaware, they remain focused not only of the fact that indeed should they ignore the warning signs of an encroaching army their flame will indeed be snuffed out, but they also focus on the building of the fire itself while they practice their War Dance.

The Initiate becomes the Adept, the Master eventually concedes and they are given the opportunity to teach their Teachers, yet they hold not on to titles nor hierarchies, nor do they seek to become Master's themselves, yet Life beckons that they Step Into Themselves, that they Rise to any and all Challenges, all the while knowing that as their fire grows larger, more and more Creatures of The Dark gather just on the outskirts of their Sacred Light.

They remain in a state of perpetual awareness, yet they focus not only on the very Real danger that exists, and they keep the Sacred Fire fed, bathing in the cleansing smoke of their Inner Smudging Ritual. They do not seek to Teach the Master, nor do they seek to Harm.

The true Adept is one who worries not about his enemies' strength, numbers, nor appearance. They know that The Creatures of The Dark have gathered in massive amounts simply because they, like the insects, are attracted to the Flame. Had they not fed their Sacred Fire the Creatures of the Dark would have ignored their small spark. The true Adept knows that they will not attack until they find a point of entry. A Weakened Spot. A Blind Spot, through which to creep in unawares. The true Adept focuses not on any of these outer realities. They know that their Body will respond, gracefully, swiftly, yet they have learned the importance of refraining from ALL impulses of "haste", for they cannot afford to make mistakes. They focus instead on their own Inner Sacred Flame, wasting no time to feed it further through practicing their Craft.

They spar with other Initates, Teachers, and Guides, not to prove themselves worthy of some reward, for their reward comes from within. They also are not unwise enough to allow any who proclaim themselves as friends to enter their sphere without first testing their Mettle. All who approach their Sacred Fire must fight them first, and afterwards they both practice their Art, trusting their friends to honorably watch their back, as they in turn watch out for their blind spots as well. They are not rattled when their sparring partner bests them. They bow in thanksgiving briefly for their Friend's kindness, and continue to attempt to do the same for their Friend.

The Demons which watch on continue to amass an Army with which to overwhelm The Adept, still unsure of their ability to successfully approach, for they know that should they fail to distract, deter, intimidate, coerce, or swindle The Adept, they will all surely be destroyed. They know The Adept to be a fierce Warrior who will not hesitate to, if necessary, obliterate them all, single-handedly should it come to such a thing.

The Adept chooses to Honor the Sacred Call upon their life, realizing that it is their own Higher Self which is doing the Calling, and as a result they do not fear the darkness, for they have their fire, and come what may, they shall fight to their dying day.

The Creatures of the Dark hide their fear in an attempt at a projection suggestive of intimidation, but like the Wolf, the Adept smells this fear, and so, they train day and night, so focused on their quest of learning The Art of Peace that they nearly forget that A War exists at all.

A novice gains entry into their circle and out of ignorance asks The Adept, "How do you remain brave when threatened with such Malice?"

The Adept looks over their shoulder into the dark, then smiles as they look back at the young Novice.

Their response is simple, "They are not yet confident enough to start their War against me. I had almost forgotten that they were there," and with this The True Adept concedes and bows deeply to the frightened Novice and says, "Thank you for reminding me of them. You need not worry with them however. Save that for later training. Know that you are under my protection while standing near to my Sacred Fire. Breathe easy, and listen for The Call, and when it comes, Honor it, for I shall not be here forever, nor do I wish to be, but I will stick around long enough to return the Favor."

The Novice is so appalled by this that they forget the Demons and asks, "What favor? What did I do?"

The Adept smiles again and urges the Novice to assume their War Stance and prepare to spar, saying, "I will explain it to you, but first you must prove to me that you have a large enough Fire within you to defeat me. I will not allow for you to harm me, but I am hoping that you have enough Self Control to keep yourself from forcing me to stop you should you prove yourself to be something other than what you appear."

The Adept is adept at what they do because they have honed their skills, learned from beggars and thieves in conjunction with Teachers and Professors. They have been taught by children, and aged men, women, and Trees. Everything to them is a Teacher and Wise Master, for they have learned to open their Ancient Eyes, and in this they have learned something of The Art of Holy Peace by learning to become highly skilled in the Holy Art of War. They worry not of the demons, nor do they trust the innocent Novice. They know that a War is being waged against them, but they seek Inner Peace, and to keep their Flame alive and burning bright for other Wanderers who may be stumbling around in the dark, lost as they once were.

This is what separates the charlatans from the sincere. This is how one creates their own reality. They take responsibility for what is theirs, clinging not unto life, nor fearing death. They have become truly Alive and so, they intend to survive, assist, and be a Part of the Whole, rather than vainly seeking to proclaim themselves as the Whole Part.

They honor the Sacred Call, tend to the Sacred Fire, and never allow themselves to become unaware of the fact that there is indeed an enemy, and that one day The Creatures of The Dark WILL attack. The Adept seeks the Way of Peace, yet practices The Holy Art of War to prepare for the day when such an Attack ensues, for they intend to Win, for they have Seen their Source Code, and know that should all of Hell rise against them, they are indeed Capable of Conquering. Until their Enemies become Brave enough to approach the Sacred Fire the Adept is content to wait, for they have observed the Cycle of Day & Night and know that when the Sun rises, the Darkness and all of it's Creatures retreat, hiding behind anything that it can to escape the Heat of Divine Fire.

The Adept knows that when the Sun breaks over the Horizon, it encompasses ALL of the Land within ITS Light, and that The Darkness of Night only resurfaces after The Sun has chosen to move Onwards. It stretches from its Eastern Horizon clear across to the Western Horizon. The North and The South are illuminated as well, and will remain such until The Sun eventually sinks, ushering in NightFall. The Adept appreciates this Cycle, thankful to The Moon and Stars for bargaining with The Sun, for should the Sun choose Not to Set, surely all of Mother Earth's creatures, plant, animal, bird, and fish, would all burn, boil, and cease to exist.

The Adept is wise, yet knows that they are not The Sun.

The Adept fears not the natural Cycle of NightFall either, and realizes The Truth.

The Creatures of The Dark are not the Children of the Night. They are simply afraid of The Sun.

This allows the Adept to See Clearly, Hear Correctly, Discern Adeptly, Smell Accurately, Taste Efficiently, and Feel the Creator's Holy Peace within their Soul, and as a result they begin to Breathe easier, softer, and their heart slows, their fear response is nullified, for the Light of Information has Enlightened their Consciousness against the Deceit of Falseness.

The Adept knows that fatigue, suffering, and pain are generally borne of Misinformation, Disinformation, and Ignorance. The knowledge they have gained has metamorphosed into True Wisdom.

They are a Warrior of The Light, and as such, they have no need to fear the Darkness. They simply have a need to prepare themselves to prevail when the inevitable Attack(s) come to claim their life and put out their Fire.

Meek as Doves, yet Wise as Serpents.

Namaste, (But for Real)
